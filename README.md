# Artificial-Intelligence-local_optimisation_problems
A repo for local search optimisation algorithms I write in Jupyter Notebook while learning about Artificial Intelligence. Local optimization algorithms are used to find the optimal solution by iteratively improving a candidate solution in the neighbourhood of the current solution.
